# OctoAcme Project Management Processes — Quick Start

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This guide provides a brief overview of how we run projects, from initiation through delivery and continuous improvement. Whether you're a new contributor, developer, product manager, or stakeholder, this overview will help you quickly understand our workflows, key roles, communication practices, and quality standards.

## Key Workflows and Conventions

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first approach to project delivery. Every project begins with a **Project One-pager** that defines the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and timeline (see [docs/octoacme-project-initiation.md](octoacme-project-initiation.md) for details). Once approved, we move into **Planning**, where work is broken into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria, estimates, and a Definition of Done ([docs/octoacme-project-planning.md](octoacme-project-planning.md)). During **Execution**, we use a project board (e.g., GitHub Projects) with columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done. Pull requests follow strict conventions: keep PRs small (≤ 400 lines when possible), link to issues, include acceptance criteria, run automated tests and linting in CI, and require at least one approval before merging. This disciplined workflow ensures transparency, reduces cycle time, and maintains high quality throughout delivery (see [docs/octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)).

## Primary Roles and Responsibilities

Our project teams are cross-functional, with clearly defined roles. The **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates delivery activities, manages schedules, risks, dependencies, and communications, ensuring the team stays aligned and on track. The **Product Manager (PdM)** defines what to build, owns the product vision, prioritizes the backlog based on customer value, and measures outcomes. **Developers** implement features, write tests, participate in code reviews, and help estimate work while identifying technical risks. **QA/Testing** validates that features meet acceptance criteria and quality standards through manual and automated testing. Each role is essential to delivering reliable, valuable software on time (see [docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed responsibilities).

## Communication Cadence and Stakeholder Updates

OctoAcme teams maintain a regular communication rhythm to ensure alignment and transparency. **Daily standups** (15 minutes) focus on progress, blockers, and dependencies. **Weekly delivery syncs** between the PM, PdM, and engineering leads review progress, update the risk register, and flag issues for escalation. **Demos or reviews** occur at the end of each sprint or milestone to showcase completed work to stakeholders. For broader visibility, **monthly stakeholder updates** summarize project status, risks, and upcoming milestones. When blockers arise, we escalate through three levels: team-level triage in standups, PM escalation to Product Lead and dependent teams, and sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues. We use weekly status templates and maintain a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for all updates (see [docs/octoacme-risks-and-communication.md](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)).

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is built into every stage of delivery at OctoAcme. We require **unit tests** for new logic, **integration tests** where applicable, and **end-to-end smoke tests** for critical flows before release. All code changes must pass **automated tests, linting, and security scanning in CI** before merging. Pre-release requirements include passing CI, security scans, drafted release notes, documented rollback plans, and smoke tests run in staging ([docs/octoacme-release-and-deployment.md](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)). If a deployment causes a critical issue, we follow a **rollback and incident playbook**: trigger incident response, rollback to the last known-good release if necessary, triage the root cause, and capture action items. After each sprint, release, or milestone, we hold **retrospectives** to capture learnings, celebrate wins, and prioritize 2-3 actionable improvements ([docs/octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)). This comprehensive quality approach minimizes production issues, enables fast feedback loops, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement.
